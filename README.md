# Sudoku-Zero
Parametric creation of Sudoku Puzzles

This project was made for my diploma thesis, on University of Patras. The specifications were as follows:

The user should be able to choose a desired difficulty level, and the application should return to him a Sudoku puzzle that 
has a unique solution, parameterized on the difficulty chosen. The creation algorithm can be analyzed in 3 different algorithms: 
the algorithm that creates a solved Sudoku puzzle, 
the parameterization of the difficulty variables and finally the digits subtraction algorithm. 
The implementation was done in the Java programming language, with Android Studio as the Interface Development Environment.
